# Artificial-Damping

This repository contains all of the Jupyter Notebooks used in the paper, "Computing Solutions of Dispersive Partial Differential Equations on the Line
with an Artificially-damped Fourier Method." To use the artificial damping method yourself, a general template has been provided in "General Method.ipynb." All of the other Jupyter Notebooks contain more optimized code for specific problems, as well as examples of how different plots were generated.
