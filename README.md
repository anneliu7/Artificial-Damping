# Artificial-Damping

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the paper, "An Artificially-damped Fourier method for dispersive evolution equations." To use the artificial damping method yourself, a general template has been provided in "General Method.ipynb." All of the other Jupyter Notebooks contain more optimized code for specific problems, as well as examples of how different plots were generated.
